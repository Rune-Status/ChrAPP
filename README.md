ChrAPP was a temporary name for my first test app using ElectronJS. I was initially testing it, 
to see how nice it is to develop with. I can definitely say I like it so far, even though I'm very new to Javascript in general.

The true name of the project is "RSEmulation CompanionScape", or "CompanionScape" for short. It's unlikely it'll
finished as it's mainly a concept similar to Minechat for Minecraft, but for RuneScape private servers.

Feel free to fork it, and work on your own versions. I'll likely update the project some more, but only to create
concepts for it's design, as I'm still very new to Javascript and very awful with HTML & CSS.
